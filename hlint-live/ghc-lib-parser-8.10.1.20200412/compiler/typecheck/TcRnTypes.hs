Various types used during typechecking, please see TcRnMonad as well for
operations on these types. You probably want to import it, instead of this
module.

All the monads exported here are built on top of the same IOEnv monad. The
monad functions like a Reader monad in the way it passes the environment
around. This is done to allow the environment to be manipulated in a stack
like fashion when entering expressions... etc.

For state that is global and should be returned at the end (e.g not part
of the stack mechanism), you should use a TcRef (= IORef) to store them.

-- | A 'NameShape' is a substitution on 'Name's that can be used

--

-- define a substitution from @{H.T}@ to @M.T@.  So a 'NameShape'
-- is computed from the list of 'AvailInfo's that are exported
-- by the implementation of a module, or successively merged
-- together by the export lists of signatures which are joining
-- together.
--
-- It's not the most obvious way to go about doing this, but it

-- | 'FrontendResult' describes the result of running the

-- a 'FrontendTypecheck', since running the frontend involves
-- typechecking a program, but for an hs-boot merge you'll
-- just get a ModIface, since no actual typechecking occurred.

-- Note [Identity versus semantic module]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- When typechecking an hsig file, it is convenient to keep track
-- of two different "this module" identifiers:
--
--      - The IDENTITY module is simply thisPackage + the module
--        name; i.e. it uniquely *identifies* the interface file
--        we're compiling.  For example, p[A=<A>]:A is an
--        identity module identifying the requirement named A
--        from library p.
--
--      - The SEMANTIC module, which is the actual module that
--        this signature is intended to represent (e.g. if
--        we have a identity module p[A=base:Data.IORef]:A,
--        then the semantic module is base:Data.IORef)
--
-- Which one should you use?
--
--      - In the desugarer and later phases of compilation,
--        identity and semantic modules coincide, since we never compile
--        signatures (we just generate blank object files for
--        hsig files.)
--
--        A corrolary of this is that the following invariant holds at any point
--        past desugaring,
--
--            if I have a Module, this_mod, in hand representing the module
--            currently being compiled,
--            then moduleUnitId this_mod == thisPackage dflags
--
--      - For any code involving Names, we want semantic modules.
--        See lookupIfaceTop in IfaceEnv, mkIface and addFingerprints
--        in MkIface, and tcLookupGlobal in TcEnv
--
--      - When reading interfaces, we want the identity module to
--        identify the specific interface we want (such interfaces
--        should never be loaded into the EPS).  However, if a
--        hole module <A> is requested, we look for A.hi
--        in the home library we are compiling.  (See LoadIface.)
--        Similarly, in RnNames we check for self-imports using
--        identity modules, to allow signatures to import their implementor.
--
--      - For recompilation avoidance, you want the identity module,
--        since that will actually say the specific interface you
--        want to track (and recompile if it changes)

-- | 'TcGblEnv' describes the top-level of the module at the
-- point at which the typechecker is finished work.
-- It is this structure that is handed on to the desugarer
-- For state that needs to be updated during the typechecking
-- phase and returned at end, use a 'TcRef' (= 'IORef').

-- If the @Show a0@ constraint that the body of the static form produces was
-- resolved in the context of the enclosing expression, then the body of the
-- static form wouldn't be closed because the Show dictionary would come from
-- g's context instead of coming from the top level.

{- Note [Tracking unused binding and imports]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We gather three sorts of usage information

 * tcg_dus :: DefUses (defs/uses)
      Records what is defined in this module and what is used.

      Records *defined* Names (local, top-level)
          and *used*    Names (local or imported)

      Used (a) to report "defined but not used"
               (see RnNames.reportUnusedNames)
           (b) to generate version-tracking usage info in interface
               files (see MkIface.mkUsedNames)
   This usage info is mainly gathered by the renamer's
   gathering of free-variables

 * tcg_used_gres :: TcRef [GlobalRdrElt]
      Records occurrences of imported entities.

      Used only to report unused import declarations

      Records each *occurrence* an *imported* (not locally-defined) entity.
      The occurrence is recorded by keeping a GlobalRdrElt for it.
      These is not the GRE that is in the GlobalRdrEnv; rather it
      is recorded *after* the filtering done by pickGREs.  So it reflect
      /how that occurrence is in scope/.   See Note [GRE filtering] in
      RdrName.

  * tcg_keep :: TcRef NameSet
      Records names of the type constructors, data constructors, and Ids that
      are used by the constraint solver.

      The typechecker may use find that some imported or
      locally-defined things are used, even though they
      do not appear to be mentioned in the source code:

      (a) The to/from functions for generic data types

      (b) Top-level variables appearing free in the RHS of an
          orphan rule

      (c) Top-level variables appearing free in a TH bracket
          See Note [Keeping things alive for Template Haskell]
          in RnSplice

      (d) The data constructor of a newtype that is used
          to solve a Coercible instance (e.g. #10347). Example
              module T10347 (N, mkN) where
                import Data.Coerce
                newtype N a = MkN Int
                mkN :: Int -> N a
                mkN = coerce

          Then we wish to record `MkN` as used, since it is (morally)
          used to perform the coercion in `mkN`. To do so, the
          Coercible solver updates tcg_keep's TcRef whenever it
          encounters a use of `coerce` that crosses newtype boundaries.

      The tcg_keep field is used in two distinct ways:

      * Desugar.addExportFlagsAndRules.  Where things like (a-c) are locally
        defined, we should give them an an Exported flag, so that the
        simplifier does not discard them as dead code, and so that they are
        exposed in the interface file (but not to export to the user).

      * RnNames.reportUnusedNames.  Where newtype data constructors like (d)
        are imported, we don't want to report them as unused.


************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
                The local typechecker environment
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

Note [The Global-Env/Local-Env story]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During type checking, we keep in the tcg_type_env
        * All types and classes
        * All Ids derived from types and classes (constructors, selectors)

At the end of type checking, we zonk the local bindings,
and as we do so we add to the tcg_type_env
        * Locally defined top-level Ids

Why?  Because they are now Ids not TcIds.  This final GlobalEnv is
        a) fed back (via the knot) to typechecking the
           unfoldings of interface signatures
        b) used in the ModDetails of this module

        f :: Eq a => T a -> Bool
        f (T1 x y) = [x]==[y]

The constructor T1 binds an existential variable 'b', and we need Eq [b].
Well, we have it, because Eq a refines to Eq [b], but we can only spot that if we
pass it inwards.

{- Node [RunSplice ThLevel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'RunSplice' stage is set when executing a splice, and only when running a
splice. In particular it is not set when the splice is renamed or typechecked.

'RunSplice' is needed to provide a reference where 'addModFinalizer' can insert
the finalizer (see Note [Delaying modFinalizers in untyped splices]), and
'addModFinalizer' runs when doing Q things. Therefore, It doesn't make sense to
set 'RunSplice' when renaming or typechecking the splice, where 'Splice',
'Brack' or 'Comp' are used instead.

-- Arrow-notation context
---------------------------

{- Note [Escaping the arrow scope]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In arrow notation, a variable bound by a proc (or enclosed let/kappa)
is not in scope to the left of an arrow tail (-<) or the head of (|..|).
For example

        proc x -> (e1 -< e2)

Here, x is not in scope in e1, but it is in scope in e2.  This can get
a bit complicated:

        let x = 3 in
        proc y -> (proc z -> e1) -< e2

Here, x and z are in scope in e1, but y is not.

We implement this by
recording the environment when passing a proc (using newArrowScope),
and returning to that (using escapeArrowScope) on the left of -< and the
head of (|..|).

All this can be dealt with by the *renamer*. But the type checker needs
to be involved too.  Example (arrowfail001)
  class Foo a where foo :: a -> ()
  data Bar = forall a. Foo a => Bar a
  get :: Bar -> ()
  get = proc x -> case x of Bar a -> foo -< a
Here the call of 'foo' gives rise to a (Foo a) constraint that should not
be captured by the pattern match on 'Bar'.  Rather it should join the
constraints from further out.  So we must capture the constraint bag
from further out in the ArrowCtxt that we push inwards.

  -- See Note [Meaning of IdBindingInfo and ClosedTypeId]

{- Note [Meaning of IdBindingInfo]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NotLetBound means that
  the Id is not let-bound (e.g. it is bound in a
  lambda-abstraction or in a case pattern)

ClosedLet means that
   - The Id is let-bound,
   - Any free term variables are also Global or ClosedLet
   - Its type has no free variables (NB: a top-level binding subject
     to the MR might have free vars in its type)
   These ClosedLets can definitely be floated to top level; and we
   may need to do so for static forms.

   Property:   ClosedLet
             is equivalent to
               NonClosedLet emptyNameSet True

(NonClosedLet (fvs::RhsNames) (cl::ClosedTypeId)) means that
   - The Id is let-bound

   - The fvs::RhsNames contains the free names of the RHS,
     excluding Global and ClosedLet ones.

   - For the ClosedTypeId field see Note [Bindings with closed types]

For (static e) to be valid, we need for every 'x' free in 'e',
that x's binding is floatable to the top level.  Specifically:
   * x's RhsNames must be empty
   * x's type has no free variables
See Note [Grand plan for static forms] in StaticPtrTable.hs.
This test is made in TcExpr.checkClosedInStaticForm.
Actually knowing x's RhsNames (rather than just its emptiness
or otherwise) is just so we can produce better error messages

Note [Bindings with closed types: ClosedTypeId]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

  f x = let g ys = map not ys
        in ...

Can we generalise 'g' under the OutsideIn algorithm?  Yes,
because all g's free variables are top-level; that is they themselves
have no free type variables, and it is the type variables in the
environment that makes things tricky for OutsideIn generalisation.

Here's the invariant:
   If an Id has ClosedTypeId=True (in its IdBindingInfo), then
   the Id's type is /definitely/ closed (has no free type variables).
   Specifically,
       a) The Id's acutal type is closed (has no free tyvars)
       b) Either the Id has a (closed) user-supplied type signature
          or all its free variables are Global/ClosedLet
             or NonClosedLet with ClosedTypeId=True.
          In particular, none are NotLetBound.

Why is (b) needed?   Consider
    \x. (x :: Int, let y = x+1 in ...)
Initially x::alpha.  If we happen to typecheck the 'let' before the
(x::Int), y's type will have a free tyvar; but if the other way round
it won't.  So we treat any let-bound variable with a free
non-let-bound variable as not ClosedTypeId, regardless of what the
free vars of its type actually are.

But if it has a signature, all is well:
   \x. ...(let { y::Int; y = x+1 } in
           let { v = y+2 } in ...)...
Here the signature on 'v' makes 'y' a ClosedTypeId, so we can
generalise 'v'.

Note that:

  * A top-level binding may not have ClosedTypeId=True, if it suffers
    from the MR

  * A nested binding may be closed (eg 'g' in the example we started
    with). Indeed, that's the point; whether a function is defined at
    top level or nested is orthogonal to the question of whether or
    not it is closed.

  * A binding may be non-closed because it mentions a lexically scoped
    *type variable*  Eg
        f :: forall a. blah
        f x = let g y = ...(y::a)...

Under OutsideIn we are free to generalise an Id all of whose free
variables have ClosedTypeId=True (or imported).  This is an extension
compared to the JFP paper on OutsideIn, which used "top-level" as a
proxy for "closed".  (It's not a good proxy anyway -- the MR can make
a top-level binding with a free type variable.)

Note [Type variables in the type environment]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The type environment has a binding for each lexically-scoped
type variable that is in scope.  For example

  f :: forall a. a -> a
  f x = (x :: a)

  g1 :: [a] -> a
  g1 (ys :: [b]) = head ys :: b

  g2 :: [Int] -> Int
  g2 (ys :: [c]) = head ys :: c

* The forall'd variable 'a' in the signature scopes over f's RHS.

* The pattern-bound type variable 'b' in 'g1' scopes over g1's
  RHS; note that it is bound to a skolem 'a' which is not itself
  lexically in scope.

* The pattern-bound type variable 'c' in 'g2' is bound to
  Int; that is, pattern-bound type variables can stand for
  arbitrary types. (see
    GHC proposal #128 "Allow ScopedTypeVariables to refer to types"
    https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/128,
  and the paper
    "Type variables in patterns", Haskell Symposium 2018.


This is implemented by the constructor
   ATyVar Name TcTyVar
in the type environment.

* The Name is the name of the original, lexically scoped type
  variable

* The TcTyVar is sometimes a skolem (like in 'f'), and sometimes
  a unification variable (like in 'g1', 'g2').  We never zonk the
  type environment so in the latter case it always stays as a
  unification variable, although that variable may be later
  unified with a type (such as Int in 'g2').

{- Note [Complete and partial type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A type signature is partial when it contains one or more wildcards
(= type holes).  The wildcard can either be:
* A (type) wildcard occurring in sig_theta or sig_tau. These are
  stored in sig_wcs.
      f :: Bool -> _
      g :: Eq _a => _a -> _a -> Bool
* Or an extra-constraints wildcard, stored in sig_cts:
      h :: (Num a, _) => a -> a

A type signature is a complete type signature when there are no
wildcards in the type signature, i.e. iff sig_wcs is empty and
sig_extra_cts is Nothing.

               -- only from the return value of TcHsType.tcAnonWildCardOcc
         }

{- Note [sig_inst_tau may be polymorphic]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that "sig_inst_tau" might actually be a polymorphic type,
if the original function had a signature like
   forall a. Eq a => forall b. Ord b => ....
But that's ok: tcMatchesFun (called by tcRhs) can deal with that
It happens, too!  See Note [Polymorphic methods] in TcClassDcl.

Note [Quantified varaibles in partial type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: forall a b. _ -> a -> _ -> b
   f (x,y) p q = q

Then we expect f's final type to be
  f :: forall {x,y}. forall a b. (x,y) -> a -> b -> b

Note that x,y are Inferred, and can't be use for visible type
application (VTA).  But a,b are Specified, and remain Specified
in the final type, so we can use VTA for them.  (Exception: if
it turns out that a's kind mentions b we need to reorder them
with scopedSort.)

The sig_inst_skols of the TISI from a partial signature records
that original order, and is used to get the variables of f's
final type in the correct order.


Note [Wildcards in partial signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The wildcards in psig_wcs may stand for a type mentioning
the universally-quantified tyvars of psig_ty

E.g.  f :: forall a. _ -> a
      f x = x
We get sig_inst_skols = [a]
       sig_inst_tau   = _22 -> a
       sig_inst_wcs   = [_22]
and _22 in the end is unified with the type 'a'

Moreover the kind of a wildcard in sig_inst_wcs may mention
the universally-quantified tyvars sig_inst_skols
e.g.   f :: t a -> t _
Here we get
   sig_inst_skols = [k:*, (t::k ->*), (a::k)]
   sig_inst_tau   = t a -> t _22
   sig_inst_wcs   = [ _22::k ]
