Description: A Haskell 98 interpreter
 Hugs is an interpreter for the non-strict, purely functional programming
 language Haskell.  This version of Hugs, Hugs 98, supports nearly all of
 the Haskell 98 specification, as well as a number of extensions.
 .
 The Haskell language is described by documents in the haskell-doc
 package.  Other libraries are documented in the ghc6-doc package.

Description: A framework for packaging Haskell software
 The Haskell Common Architecture for Building Applications and
 Libraries: a framework defining a common interface for authors to more
 easily build their Haskell applications in a portable way.
 .
 The Haskell Cabal is meant to be a part of a larger infrastructure
 for distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries
 and tools.
 .
 This is the version bundled with the interpreter.

Description: Compatibility with Haskell 98
 This package provides compatibility with the modules of Haskell
 98 and the FFI addendum, by means of wrappers around modules from
 the base package (which in many cases have additional features).
 However Prelude, Numeric and Foreign are provided directly by
 the base package.
 .
 This is the version bundled with the interpreter.
